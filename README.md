# <Challenge-1-Refactoring-Kyle-Curry>

## Description

In this challenge I was given a webpage and challenged to update the code to meet accessibility standards while functionality and appearance of the webage remains unchanged. This was done by implementing semantic HTML elements, making sure the semantic elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, adding accessible alt attributes to icon and image elements,confirming heading attributes fall in sequential order, and giving the webpage a concise, descriptive title. This allows web browsers to help accessibility and functionality for people with disabilities. In doing this I found an inclusive and thoughtful corner of coding I did not know previously existed and ways to do your part to help.
