# <Challenge-1-Refactoring-Kyle-Curry>

## Description

In this challenge I was given a webpage and challenged to update the code to meet accessibility standards. This was done by implementing semantic HTML elements, making sure the semantic elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, adding accessible alt attributes to icon and image elements,confirming heading attributes fall in sequential order, and giving the webpage a concise, descriptive title. This allows web browsers to help accessibility and functionality for people with disabilities. In doing this I found an inclusive and thoughtful corner of coding I did not know previously existed.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
